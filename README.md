# YouTube MP3 Downloader GUI
Download and tag MP3 files from YouTube.

## Introduction
Developed in Python and powered by the PySide6 library, this modest software aims to provide a convenient solution for downloading MP3
files directly from YouTube videos. It also includes a basic tagging functionality to help manage your music library. I kindly remind users to
respect copyright laws and only download videos you have the rights to.

## How to install (for regular users)

Step 1: Download and install Python 3.12 from https://www.python.org/. Make sure to check the box to add Python to the PATH during the installation.

Step 2: Download FFmpeg and add it to the PATH. There are many excellent tutorials available, and itâ€™s fairly simple to do.

Step 3: Download the project as a zip file and extract the contents.

Step 4: Open the project folder, right-click inside the folder and open a terminal. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Step 5: To run the application, create a batch file (app.bat) in the project folder with the following code: `python app.py`.
You can then create a shortcut to this batch file on your desktop for easy access.

## How to use
Enter the link of the YouTube video you're interested in, then fill in the tags of your choice. Choose the MP3 quality in the settings or leave it at
the default setting. Once the tags are to your liking and everything is set, click on 'Download'. An MP3 file will be created and tagged directly in
your downloads folder.
